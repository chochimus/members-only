## Description

This web app is a simple 'post-board' style project for me to practice my understanding of some of the technologies I have been learning.

## Goal

To help cement my understanding of working with technologies like Express and some of its libraries, the MVC pattern, postgreSQL, session passport.js. The main features are authenticated log-in, proper handling of sensitive data, as well as the ability to offer different views depending on a users membership level.
